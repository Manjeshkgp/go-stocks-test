This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Manjeshkgp/go-stocks-test.git
```

When it is cloned, it may be named as go-stocks-test, so move to that directory

```
cd go-stocks-test
```

Then install npm packages

```
npm install
```

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can do this via yarn, pnpm or bun as well.
